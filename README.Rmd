The goal of denverweed is to provide a simple dataset for analysis which shows the different uses of wide/long form data, while giving insight into the trials and tribulations undergone by America’s favorite smokeable/tokeable 5-to-13 leafletted plant 

## Installation

The development version of denverweed is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
```{r}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("Reed-Math241/pkgGrpm")
```



## About the data 

The data were collected and made available by the [City of Denver Open Data Catalog](http://data.denvergov.org).

the denverweed package contains two datasets. 
```{r}
library(pkgGrpm)
data(package = 'pkgGrpm')
```


It contains the dataset `weed`, which contains 4 variables and 90 observations:

```{r}
head(weed)
```

It also contains `weed_wider`, a pivoted, untidy version of `weed` which may be useful for certain graphs, containing 4 variables and 45 rows

```{r}
head(weed_wider)
```

## Example

gross sales by year, faceted by medical or retail 
```{r, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6} 
ggplot(weed, aes(x = YEAR, y = GROSS_SALES)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#709B40') +
  facet_wrap(~GROSS_SALES_TYPE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  ylab("Gross Sales ($)") + 
  xlab("Year")+
  theme_bw()
```

gross sales by month, faceted by year 
```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}

ggplot(weed, aes(x = MONTH, y = GROSS_SALES)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#709B40') +
  facet_wrap(~YEAR) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  ylab("Gross Sales ($)") + 
  xlab("Month") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

```

gross sales by month, faceted by year and retail/medical

```{r, fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(weed, aes(x = MONTH, y = GROSS_SALES)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#709B40') +
  facet_grid(GROSS_SALES_TYPE ~ YEAR) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  ylab("Gross Sales ($)") + 
  xlab("Month") +
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))


```

finally, a use for `weed_wider` in a scatterplot of medical vs retail sales, by year


```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}

ggplot(weed_wider, aes(x = `Medical Total Gross Sales`, y = `Retail Total Gross Sales`, color = YEAR)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
   scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme_bw()
```
